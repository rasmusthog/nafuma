# About

This package contains data processing, analysis and viewing tools written in Python for several different activities related to inorganic materials chemistry conducted in the NAFUMA-group at the University of Oslo. It is written with the intention of creating a reproducible workflow for documentation purposes, with a focus on interactivity in the data exploration process. 

As of now (08-04-22), the intention is to include tools for XRD-, XANES- and electrochemistry-analysis, however other modules might be added as well.
